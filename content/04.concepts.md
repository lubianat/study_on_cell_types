terminal selectors:  a novel and unique combination of transcription factors, which establish a cell type identity 

sister cell types: "Dopaminergic neurons and the glutamatergic neurons of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are different, but share similar signatures"

core regulatory complex’ (CoRC) of transcription factors, that make emergent sister cell types distinct, enable their independent evolution and regulate cell type-specific traits termed apomeres.

apomeres cell type specific modules.

synapomeres if descendant sister cell types undergo additional rounds of evolutionary diversification. 

cell type homology due to inheritance from a common precursor


concerted evolution (of cell types) occurs through mutations affecting genetic information used by multiple cell types

regulatory signature / character identity : The full set of terminal selectors driving differentiation, together with microRNAs, splicing complexes and any
other regulatory mechanism that establishes and maintains the differential use of genomic information of a cell within the organism.

serial sister cell types

Cell type homology: Cell types that trace back to the same cell type in a common ancestor.

Cell phenotypic convergence: Cell types that are
phenotypically similar due to independent changes occurring in separate evolutionary lineages.

Concerted evolution: Similar phenotypic changes that occur simultaneously across different cell types of the same species as a result of altering genetic information shared among the cell types.

‘Recombination’ between cell types" as a mechanism to form new cell types in the end highlights the notion of intersected cell types

## Defining cell types and states with single-cell genomics
    \cite{trapnell2015defining
    
attractor is a location in the state space of a dynamical system that will move toward and to which it will return if perturbed. (" what we think of as distinct cell types correspond to attractors of that system (Kauffman 1993)"

bricolage/tinkering:  novel traits originate as new combinations of existing traits

## Mapping the transcriptional diversity of genetically and anatomically defined cell populations in the mouse brain

Pan-neuronal genes (genes expressed commonly in all neuronal populations but expressed at lower levels or not at all in nonneuronal cell populations.

## Terminal Selectors of Neuronal Identity
    \cite{hobert2016terminal    
Given the neuron identity-defining properties, I proposed to call these transcription factors “terminal selectors.This terminology is an extension of the selector gene concept, originally proposed by Garcia-Bellido (1975).

In such cases it is possible to compare if the predicted cell type matches the ‘biological’ cell type. We identified 17 independent datasets with homogeneous cell-type populations, where the biological cell type has been reported (this
