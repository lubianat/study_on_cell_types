Immunity functions through the concerted actions of diverse cell types with specialized tasks

% Cell types or cells??
Hence, a central goal of modern immunology has been to catalogue cells in an effort to unify observations, generate hypotheses and propose basic biological principles

However, ‘naming’ subsets creates rules and restrictions that typically prevent capturing the true biology of a cell. This observation is particularly evident for‘plastic’ immune cells, for which the capacity to adapt to environmental changes is a defining property


Neutrophils are traditionally defined as a type of myeloid cell with a short half- life, specific nuclear morphology, defined granule content and surface expression of markers, such as the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked
receptor Ly6G in mice or CD66b in humans.

% Conceptual definition which cannot be applied in practice: how to know that any given cell matches these characteristics??

neutrophils have been described in a variety of 'flavours'
% Simply different cell types

In this Opinion article, we present
a critical discussion of neutrophil heterogeneity

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in humans.

Historically, granulocyte precursors in humans have been defined from density gradients followed by histological inspection of the different fractions upon Giemsa staining9

Three neutrophil subsets within the mouse bone marrow: a committed proliferative precursor, termed a pre- neutrophil, which sequentially differentiates into non- proliferating immature and mature neutrophils.

In addition to the various types of immature neutrophils at different stages of maturation, the bone marrow is also a site for recycling of circulating neutrophils, at least in mice. Indeed, a large fraction of mature neutrophils that have aged in the circulation are recruited back to the bone marrow with circadian frequency.

Under steady-state conditions, neutrophils and other leukocyte subsets are released from the bone marrow and circulate for about half a day before infiltrating tissues.

Although the relatively short time of neutrophils in the blood would suggest homogeneous properties of these cells, marked diurnal changes in phenotype do occur, a phenomenon referred to as neutrophil ageing.

Notably, these features are significantly blunted in the early morning in mice, when neutrophils are recently released from the bone marrow. This finding suggests that neutrophils adjust their functions to the changing demands of the day — for example, to protect from microbial invasions during the animal’s active phase (when the exposure to pathogens is highest) or to exert reparative functions during the resting phase. 

% That is of utmost importance! How many articles state in which circadian moment an statement is valid?
% Whenever the times of collection are not randomized, this introduces systematic bias! 

at circadian clock genes also regulate the diurnal variations in phenotype and function in a cell- intrinsic manner34
through a process similar to that reported for inflammatory monocytes40

Do tissue- specific neutrophils exist?

% Obviously 

marginal zoneneutrophils in the human spleen adopt unique B cell-stimulating properties through the secretion of cytokines, chemoattractants and the pattern recognition receptor pentraxin 3 that stimulate class switch recombination and immunoglobulin production by B cells that reside in this region54,55

### Highlights

Identifying the functionally distinct types of neuron is central to any bottom-up understanding of how the brain works.

How are neuronal types distinguished and why do neurobiologists care so much about them?

What do we mean by a cell type? This question has generated much tedious discussion, but the ultimate goal is simple — to find a way to single out a group of neurons that carry out a distinct task.

Increasingly, cell types can be distinguished by their expression of genes and/or proteins. Occasionally they are first distinguished by characteristic patterns of electrical activity. But the commonest way is the shape of the cell

For convenience, neuroanatomists from Cajal’s time to the present have given them evocative nicknames, as shown in Figure 1B, but this is only a mnemonic device.

The names have varying degrees of exactness and currency, ranging from the famously distinctive Purkinje cell to many lesser, poorly defined cells. Like genes, some cells appear under several names.

A particularly unfortunate piece of vagueness pertains to the hierarchy of groups. Terms like ‘variety’, ‘class’, ‘type’, ‘subclass’, and ‘subtype’ are used indiscriminately. The technically correct usage is perhaps for a ‘class’ to represent a collection of ‘types’ that share a common feature. In this usage there is no place for a ‘subclass’—indeed, there is probably a need for more taxonomic levels. The term ‘type’ is sometimes reserved for the terminally differentiated level, and that usage will be followed here.

The term ‘pyramidal cell’ is used for neurons in several brain structures (there are
hippocampal pyramidal cells) and generally denotes a large cell with a roughly triangular soma from which arise distinct sets of apical and basal dendrites.

t is believed that many cell types exist within the large class of neocortical pyramidal cells, but there is at present no powerful and universally agreed way to distinguish them

A mammalian retina contains five major classes of neurons divided into ~60 individual types.

The intrinsic neurons are the horizontal cells (2 types), bipolar cells (~12 types) and amacrine cells (~30 types).

Finally, individual types of retinal neuron exhibit regular spacing, such that neurons of a defined type maintain a minimum distance from other neurons of the same type.

For the first time in any substantially complex CNS structure, the inventory of cell types in the retina appears to be virtually complete.
