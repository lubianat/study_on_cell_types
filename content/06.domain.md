## Heterogeneity of neutrophils
    [@doi:10.1038/s41577-019-0141-8]
    
### Highlights

Immunity functions through the concerted actions of diverse cell types with specialized tasks

Hence, a central goal of modern immunology has been to catalogue cells in an effort to unify observations, generate hypotheses and propose basic biological principles

--> Cell types or cells??

However, ‘naming’ subsets creates rules and restrictions that typically prevent capturing the true biology of a cell. This observation is particularly evident for‘plastic’ immune cells, for which the capacity to adapt to environmental changes is a defining property

In this Opinion article, we present a critical discussion of neutrophil heterogeneity.

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in humans. Historically, granulocyte precursors in humans have been defined from density gradients followed by histological inspection of the different fractions upon Giemsa staining. In addition to the various types of immature neutrophils at different stages of maturation, the bone marrow is also a site for recycling of circulating neutrophils, at least in mice.

Under steady-state conditions, neutrophils circulate for about half a day before infiltrating tissues. Marked diurnal changes in phenotype do occur, a phenomenon referred to as neutrophil ageing. Neutrophils adjust their functions to the changing demands of the day — for example, to protect from microbial invasions during the animal’s active phase (when the exposure to pathogens is highest) or to exert reparative functions during the resting phase. 

--> That is of utmost importance! How many articles state in which circadian moment an statement is valid?
    Whenever the times of collection are not randomized, this introduces systematic bias! 

Do tissue- specific neutrophils exist?

--> Obviously 

Marginal zone neutrophils in the human spleen adopt unique B cell-stimulating properties.

### Highlights

Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood NK cells identified distinct NK cell immunotypes  linked to disease severity.

NK cells aretypically divided into cytokine-producing CD56bright NK cells and cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells.
Patients with  COVID-19 disease were sampled for peripheral blood, and analyzed by 28-color flow cytometry.

Preprocessed scRNA-seq data were obtained from a published dataset (24). CD8 T cells were excluded from downstream NK cell analyses based on k-means clustering of CD8 and NK cell markers from the human cell atlas PBMC benchmarking dataset, followed by renormalization of the data.

## Neuronal cell types
    [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.035]

### Highlights

How are neuronal types distinguished and why do neurobiologists care so much about them?

What do we mean by a cell type? This question has generated much tedious discussion, but the ultimate goal is simple — to find a way to single out a group of neurons that carry out a distinct task.Increasingly, cell types can be distinguished by their expression of genes and/or proteins. Occasionally they are first distinguished by characteristic patterns of electrical activity. But the commonest way is the shape of the cell

For convenience, neuroanatomists from Cajal’s time to the present have given them evocative nicknames,but this is only a mnemonic device. Like genes, some cells appear under several names.

A particularly unfortunate piece of vagueness pertains to the hierarchy of groups. Terms like ‘variety’, ‘class’, ‘type’, ‘subclass’, and ‘subtype’ are used indiscriminately. The technically correct usage is perhaps for a ‘class’ to represent a collection of ‘types’ that share a common feature. In this usage there is no place for a ‘subclass’—indeed, there is probably a need for more taxonomic levels. The term ‘type’ is sometimes reserved for the terminally differentiated level, and that usage will be followed here.

The term ‘pyramidal cell’ is used for neurons in several brain structures (there are hippocampal pyramidal cells). It is believed that many cell types exist within the large class of neocortical pyramidal cells, but there is at present no powerful and universally agreed way to distinguish them.

A mammalian retina contains five major classes of neurons divided into ~60 individual types.

--> The concept of majority of cell types is intriguing

For the first time in any substantially complex CNS structure, the inventory of cell types in the retina appears to be virtually complete.

## Cell type nomenclature for the mammalian brain: Development and application of a systematic, extensible convention
    [@url:https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05406]
    
### Highlights

We created a working nomenclature convention for matching and tracking cell types across studies. It augments existing cell type names and can be directly applied to data.We propose conventions for assigning accurate yet flexible cell types names in the mammalian cortex as a step towards a much larger community-wide effort to organize multi-source, data-driven information related to cell types.

Studies combining scRNA-seq with morphological and electrophysiological characterizations have found a more complicated relationship in the brain than in retina, with cell types defined by morphology and electrophysiology sometimes containing cells from several cell types defined using gene expression, and some transcriptomically-defined types containing cells with multiple morphologies.

Within a single study, cell types need to be quantitatively defined, organized, named, and annotated by comparison to published work and cell metadata.

For essentially all published studies, clusters (or provisional cell types; see below) are defined.

Resulting clusters are often presented as “cell types,” though likely represent a combination of cell types, cell states (such as cell cycle or cell activation), and the intersection of discrete cell types with more continuous variation. In some cases, clusters can then be linked with well-established historical types captured in a cell type ontology, or a structured controlled vocabulary for grouping information,

- how do we quantitatively define cell types in an individual study?

- how do we annotate cell types using experimental and historical context?

- how do we compare and match cell types identified in different studies?

- how should those cell types be named in a way that provides historical or comparative context?

Some investigators use generic names like “interneuron 1” or “Ex1” and then use figures, tables, or text to link these clusters to historical cell types.
Others advocate for chaining critical cell type features in the name itself.
Allen Institute assigns names that reference marker genes and metadata from a given dataset, such as “Exc L5–L6 THEMIS C1QL3” 

- what data/metadata infrastructure is required to achieve these goals of cell type classification in a scalable way? 

Any solution should be user-friendly and should directly address some of the challenges of ontology, data matching, and cell type naming in its implementation.

At the core of the proposal are two key concepts: a taxonomy which must be generated prior to implementation of this schema, and a cell set, which can represent any collection of cells within a specific taxonomy. Provisional cell types (sometimes called cell types for convenience) are particularly important cell sets that represent quantitatively-derived data clusters defined by the classification algorithm that generated the taxonomy.

Analysis of each dataset will create a taxonomy of cell clusters that needs to be tracked.

Each taxonomy is assigned a unique taxonomy id of the format CS[YYMMDD][#], where “CS” stands for cell set; Y, M, and D represent year, month, and day; and # is an index for compiling multiple taxonomies on a single day. Taxonomies can be defined using a single dataset or through alignment of multiple datasets.

Cell set IDs track unique cell sets and are defined as [taxonomy id][unique # within taxonomy]. Cell set labels provide general tags for more broadly-defined cell types (e.g., “neuron”) and are defined as [Canonical cell type][unique # within canonical cell type].

Cell set aliases include any number of cell set descriptors intended for public consumption, including any cell type names used in manuscripts.

Each cell set can have at most one preferred alias, which is a biologically-driven term that is selected from a controlled vocabulary, and that only can be assigned for cell sets with confident matches across taxonomies

- Provisional cell type: Quantitatively-derived data cluster defined within a taxonomy. Sometimes called “cell type” here for simplicity
- Cell set accession ID: A unique ID across all tracked datasets and taxonomies.
- Cell set alias: Any cell set descriptor (e.g., what cell types are called in a paper).
- Cell set label: An ID unique within a single taxonomy that contains a biological term that ideally is included in a relevant cell ontology.
- Cell set preferred alias:  Analogous to “gene symbol”. At most one biologically- driven name for linking matching cell sets across taxonomies and with a reference taxonomy. 

It is necessary for this schema to be easy to understand and applicable to novel and published datasets.

As a whole, this workflow provides a general outline for versioned cell type classification and that provides a starting point for design of future cell taxonomy and nomenclature databases.

In a reference taxonomy, the preferred alias should match cell types defined in the relevant ontology (i.e., Cell Ontology or Neuron Phenotype Ontology), _at the highest level of resolution possible_.

The proposed schema can represent the matching of Chandelier cells between single-species transcriptomics datasets, the integrated transcriptomics reference and  link with other modalities using preferred alias tags.

Ontology curation would allow users to link data-derived cell sets to common usage terms.

A recent paper presents a static browser of more than 370 transcriptomically-defined cell types in mouse hippocampus and cortex, with many of
the features mentioned above, for a single taxonomy: https://taxonomy.shinyapps.io/ctx_hip_browser/.

More ambitious, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) has proposed a tool to facilitate convergence on common cell type nomenclature through a combination of automated suggestions and other strategies, and that could potentially address some of these use cases directly. This Cell Annotation Platform is a centralized ecosystem for defining cell types and states for the Human Cell Atlas, and beyond, and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/cap-example). Whatever strategy is chosen could directly access and improve upon the proposed nomenclature convention

## Neuronal diversity: Too many cell types for comfort?
    [@doi:10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70454-3]
    
### Highlights
Bad news by the more parsimonious among us: there are too many different types of neurons in the brain! The lowly retina has at least a dozen distinct types of ganglion cell and more than two dozen types of amacrine cell.

Perhaps if we look at a more central brain region, such as the hippocampus, we can find some comfort for the lumpers over the splitters. No such comfort comes out of the recent work of Parra et al, who have examined inhibitory cell types in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. 

If we can accept the tiling principle clearly revealed in the retina then there could be at least as many as 350 types of inhibitory neurons — or 700 types if 20% of all hippocampal neurons are inhibitory — a lot more than the 50 thought to be there by Parra et al.

If we take the number of inhibitory hippocampal neuron types to be about 35, then the redundancy in inhibitory cells would be about 10, so that one could anticipate good continued function with a random loss of 10% or even 20% of the population.

### Highlights

Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal created a ‘portrait gallery’ of neurons.

(...)
The authors identified more than 100 different cell types, including 61 types of inhibitory neuron and 56 types of excitatory neuron. They found that most cell types were present in both cortical areas — with the exception of excitatory neurons

Functional specialization of cortical areas might rely not only on differences in microcircuits and connectivity patterns, but also on the use of different cell types to process information.

Economo et al. engineered each subpopulation of neurons to express the protein channelrhodopsin — a light-sensitive ion channel. This enables neuronal activity to be precisely controlled using light (a method known as optogenetics), and so allowed the authors to dissect the roles of the upper and the lower layer-5 neurons in different types of motor function. These markers could be used to design more optogenetic experiments that target specific neuronal populations; to investigate whether ‘area-specific’ cell types can be found in other cortical regions;

## Neuron Names: A Gene- and Property-Based Name Format, With Special Reference to Cortical Neurons
[@doi:10.3389/fnana.2019.00025]

### Highlights
Clarity will therefore be enhanced by conveying as much as possible the genes and properties in the neuron name.

--> I tend to disagree, in light of URL-resolvable idenfiers. But the principle is sound. 

Most terms for neurons are holdovers from the nineteenth century, when it was discovered that nerve cells appear as distinct types based on the structure and location of their axons, dendrites and cell bodies.

All attempts to bring order into this daunting terminological jungle originate in the vast overview contained in Ramón y Cajal’s (1911) great work Histologie du système nerveux de l’homme & des vertébrés.

The SenseLab suite of databases, initiated in 1993 , contains NeuronDB, which has focused on the terminology and properties of many of the most highly investigated neurons.

The importance of establishing a common cell type nomenclature across species cannot be overstated. The nomenclature could follow a hierarchical order, starting at the highest level: the species, then the brain region annotated based on a unified anatomical reference atlas system with cross-correlations among species, and then the cell type as defined by a multimodal feature set (including locational, molecular, morphological, physiological, and ontological features) (ed. italics). The nomenclature should be a culmination of knowledge gained about the cellular organization of the nervous system.

Any nomenclature format must also take account of the fact that a given property may not always be present. As will be discussed, current research is showing that the properties that define a neuron are dependent on many dynamic factors, reflecting different functional states that can include differences in gene expression.

In general, it may be useful to distinguish three conceptual levels of description: a common term (the label), a definition (a combination of key properties), and additional features (other non-essential properties).

A comprehensive attempt was made by the “Petilla Conference” to list the most common properties used to classify the inhibitory interneurons of the cerebral cortex in 2008

The classical unimodal anatomical approach based on structure, however, is not enough in a molecular era.

Each full name technically would begin by indicating the species (and where applicable the strain), gender, and age.

Every neuron name has the flexibility of being augmented (to select subsets) or diminished (selecting supersets) to match the study.

The lumbar ventral horn contains two types of neurons: large cells, motor neurons, which have long axons that innervate the skeletal muscles and muscle spindles, and small cells, which have short axons that stay within the anterior horn .

The many potential types might suggest that we should try to lump as many as possible together to make our database more manageable

--> I strongly disagree! Let`s embrace large databases. 

However, a better conclusion is that this approach to neuron terminology is revealing one of the essential features of the neocortex: the uniquely large number of different neuron types, each potentially able to process information in ways that differ either slightly or radically in generating enhanced behavior of the animal.

--> Now I agree :)

The functional properties of a brain region are state dependent: they vary depending on the behavioral state of the animal. A nomenclature must regard these added complexities not as problems but as opportunities to reflect the nervous system as it really is.

In conclusion, we summarize the advantages of moving toward a systematic format for neuron names in which traditional names based on structure are extended to include genes and functional properties.

Ultimately, a multimodal approach incorporating continuously variable cell types will facilitate an accurate reductionist interpretation of the nervous system.

## The BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Consortium: Lessons Learned toward Generating a Comprehensive Brain Cell Atlas
[@doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2017.10.007]

### Highlights
Here we review the experiences of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Consortium, ten pilot projects funded by the U.S. BRAIN Initiative. 

Since the initial discovery of diverse neuronal cell types over a century ago by Ramon y Cajal (1899), we have yet to obtain a full description of the different cell types present in the mammalian brain

Cataloging of gene expression patterns of all genes expressed in the CNS by RNA in situ hybridization (Lein et al., 2007) can define broad classes of cells, but they can not distinguish cells that are defined by the co-expression genes.

However, since a cell’s transcriptome represents just one aspect of its identity, additional work is needed to integrate others to devise a principled framework with which to create a taxonomy of cell types in the brain.

on June 5, 2014, the BRAIN Initiative working group delivered "BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision", a document outlining a plan for the U.S. BRAIN Initiative (https://www.braininitiative. nih.gov/pdf/BRAIN2025_508C.pdf). 

7 major goals, of which the first was (1) to identify and provide experimental access to different brain cell types to determine their roles in health and disease

A comprehensive adult cell atlas will involve multiple brain regions across multiple individuals and will need to consider age, potentially including adolescent, mid-life, and elderly, as an important variable.

A study of hematopoietic differentiation using single-cell ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin accessibility at enhancers was more effective at classifying cell types than gene expression profiles (Corces et al., 2016)

--> What does it mean to be more effective?

Sparse labeling of brain cytoarchitecture by the Golgi method transformed neuroanatomy at the turn of the last century (Golgi, 1873; Ramon y Cajal, 1904). Today, similar sparse visualization of specific cell types in the mouse brain is possible by viral vector-based labeling.

Comparisons across groups allow us to identify universal principles common to multiple cell types  and specific cell types implicated in the etiology of neurologic diseases.

Toward the ultimate goal of understanding cell types in the human brain, we suggest that cross-species comparison of cell types be conducted across at least three mammalian species: mouse, a non-human primate species, and human. A complete inventory of cell types should include information about the defining features, proportions, and spatial distributions of all cell types, and this information must be provided in the context of a framework, including nomenclature, common across species

--> Explicitly suggests we look for archetypes

The importance of establishing a common cell type nomenclature across species cannot be overstated. 

All cell types within each region will likely be arranged in a hierarchical manner as well to reflect their relative closeness to each other. Across species, such hierarchical organization of cell types might be similar overall, but species-specific major or minor branches of cell types will also be recognized. 

The goals of the BICCN are to deliver the following: 
- a deep characterization of the diversity of cell types and the logic of their three-dimensional organization in the brain; 
- an open-access three-dimensional digital reference atlas with molecular, anatomical, and
- physiological annotations of brain cell types in the mouse

## Neuronal cell-type classification: challenges, opportunities and the path forward
[@doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.85]

### Highlights

Conceptual difficulties persist. Borrowing from the field of species taxonomy, we propose principles to be followed in the cell-type classification effort, including:
- the incorporation of multiple, quantitative features as criteria, 
- the use of discontinuous variation to define types and 
- the creation of a hierarchical system to represent relationships between cells. 

We review the progress of classifying cell types in the retina and cerebral cortex and propose a staged approach for moving forward with a systematic cell-type classification in the nervous system. 

Many have come to believe that systematic categorization of cell types is an essential prerequisite for understanding mechanisms, and the descriptive enterprise has been revived.

It is difficult to know how fine and firm the distinctions used to distinguish neuronal types from one another should be. If we take account of all the differences between neurons the very notion of neuronal types becomes ephemeral. Conversely, coarse distinctions ( (motor neurons or cortical pyramidal cells, for example) are of little value for many experimental purposes. Is there a ‘sweet spot’ somewhere in between?

Purposes of cell-type classification:

- Reproducibility. One important purpose of neuronal classification is to enable the same types of neurons to be studied repeatedly.

Crick, who noted, “It is common for the experimentalist to record that, say, 25% of the neurons studied behave in a particular way, 37% in a different way and a further 15% in a third way. There is no indication what type of neuron they are. This is not science but rather natural history” (REF. 14).

- Genetic access. Increasingly, one goal of classification is to enable genetic access to specific cell types so that they can be marked and/or manipulated

- Discovery.As known cell types are catalogued, previously unrecognized ones may emerge.

- Studying disease. Some brain diseases primarily affect specific cell types.

- Generating a ‘parts list’. It is therefore fair to say that we have no hope of understanding the brain without an accounting of cell types and their properties.

Another problem is that a unifying definition of neuronal type should involve all three categories of properties: physiological, morphological and molecular. Although such a satisfying correspondence has been shown for some types, it seems unlikely that this will always be the case.

Cell non‑autonomy also limits the utility of neuronal connectivity as a criterion: the loss of synaptic inputs or targets can alter a neuron’s place in a circuit without causing any direct change to the neuron itself. Conversely, not all molecular properties are cell autonomous or static.

The problems of defining species and neuronal cell types are similar in many ways, suggesting that there may be lessons to learn from the systematists.

It has been proposed that a cell type should be defined as “a set of cells… that change in evolution together… and are evolutionarily more closely related to each other than to other cells”. In practice, however, there are few cases in which data are available to make this judgement. It may be more realistic to find ways to classify types within a species and then use that classification to launch an evolutionary inquiry.

--> The Arendt article is really influential

Perhaps most useful is a third school of systematics, known as typological, taxonomic or phenetic systematics, which groups individuals into species according to their similarity of genotype and/or phenotype. There are several key principles that this approach advocates, which may provide lessons for cell‑type classification.

--> Yes! The phenetic line seems to be the most in concert with my classification goals.

 - Group (that is, ‘type’) membership should be based on multiple criteria rather than on a single so‑called ‘essential’ feature that the investigator favours. 
 - The criteria for group membership should be rule‑based, explicit and quantitative.
 - Groupings should be hierarchical rather than flat to acknowledge the validity of both coarse and fine divisions.
 - Groupings generated by this approach should be viewed as hypotheses to be tested rather than inflexible rules.
 - Classification should focus on discontinuities between groups and ignore parameters that vary continuously.

 --> These points are super in line with my theoretical views on cell types.

Cell‑type categorization for all retinal neuronal classes is well underway. Light microscopic validation of the physiologically and molecularly defined types provided strong evidence indicating that all the criteria converged on the same set of types.

In general, cortical neurons are divided into two classes, namely, glutamatergic excitatory neurons and GABAergic inhibitory neurons, with multiple ‘subclasses’ within each class.The generation of many interneuron specific GFP mouse lines has increased our knowledge about interneuron types. Nonetheless, it is still unclear exactly how many cell types constitute each inhibitory subclass.

Criteria. Taxonomists stress that group membership should be based on multiple criteria rather than a single ‘essential’ feature. A corollary is that groups should not be named for the supposedly essential feature, as this will often end up being misleading. 

Indeed, there may be no single characteristic that is possessed by every group member. As noted by Tyner, a pioneer in applying insights from systematics to neuroscience, “A biological population can be described in terms of a substantial list of features such that (a) each member of the group possesses a large number of the features; (b) each feature is possessed by a large number of individuals in the group; and (c) no feature is necessarily possessed by every member of the group”.

--> I slightly disagree with that for the case of cell types. 
    I believe that "essential" classes are used in practice for
    experimental definitions of cell tipes. 

Use of hierarchical (multilevel) rather than flat (single‑level) classification systems has the following two advantages: it includes relationships between types as an intrinsic feature of the classification, and it provides a flexible way to update the system in light of new information.

Ultimately, this will be informative and useful not only in refining the cell‑type classification but also in understanding the relationship between a cell’s variable states and its core cell‑type identity.

Classification should be based on a hierarchical scheme (as described above) so that additional groupings can be added or interpo‑ated as new information becomes available

Overall, the enterprise of cell‑type classification has the potential to transform our view of nervous system function and malfunction. Many problems remain, and, as is the case for species taxonomy, cell‑type classification schemes need to be regarded as hypotheses to be tested and refined as we move through these stages. Nonetheless, the pace of progress is rapid, and some of the conceptual and technical challenges that seem formidable today are likely to be surmounted over the next decade.

## Naming of neurones. Classification and naming of cat retinal ganglion cells
    [@wikidata:Q41052480]

### Highlights
Many schemes of ganglion cell classification seek to classify the cells by some particular characteristic, such as the time course of the cells’ physiological responses or their dendritic morphology. It is here argued that such schemes are based on the Aristotelian concept of ‘essences’ and raise the same difficulties as have arisen with the essentialist approach to animal taxonomy. A better approach to the classification of neurones, it is proposed, is to base the classification on as many features of the cells as possible, and to regard the classification as an hypothesis, sub? ject to testing and modification by experience, about the ‘functional niches’ occupied by the cell types distinguished.

One aim of this article is to examine the logical presuppositions of different systems of ganglion cell nomenclature. A second aim is to use the conceptual framework provided by taxonomic theory to examine the logical and practical strengths of particular schemes of classification proposed for cat retinal ganglion cells. Our third aim is to develop a theoretical basis for the classifying and naming of neurones which is relevant to any population of neurones, in any species.

The categorising of properties as ‘accidental’ has often downgraded interest in them, resulting, as Tyner [1975] expresses it, ‘in much data being effectively discarded by either labelling atypical individuals “unnatural” or by creating for them new groups containing extremely small fractions of the total sample.’

The term W cell was chosen because the alphabetical sequence W/X/Y then follows the increasing axonal velocities of the three types

The choice of non-descriptive labels is noteworthy because it avoids in a simple way the use of the Aristotelian concept of essences. The cells might, for example, have been termed ‘linear’ and ‘non-linear’, which would have implied that these features were their essential characteristics. With hindsight, it is apparent that the ability of the X/Y nomenclature to accommodate readily the considerable subsequent accumulation of knowledge about the variability present in the properties of X and Y cells stems principally from the fact that, while various features were of course attributed to cells of a particular label, no single feature was initially defined as essential to the dichotomy.

The sluggish / brisk / sustained / transient / concentric / non-concentric scheme for classifying cells is obviously more cumbersome verbally than the Y/X/W scheme. The expanded set of descriptive terms might be valuable if they either avoided problems raised by the simpler non-descriptive terminology or illuminated relationships which were otherwise obscured.

In short, the Aristotelian essentialist approach, by creating sharp categories of cells, tends to make divisions among them which may be artificial. This tendency has been previously noted in the taxonomy of animals. The fatal flaw in essentialism is that there is no way of determining what the essential properties of an organism are and why these and no other properties are essential.’

--> We can have a "working essentialism" of  a set of properties.

The first problem is the tend? ency of the essentialist approach to make no distinction between descrip? tion and definition. In animal taxonomy, this distinction is embodied in the distinction between taxa and categories [Bock, 1973; see below]. Ca? tegories, such as family or species, can be defined, but taxa, such as Felidae or Felis domesticus, may only be described.

Cleland and Levick’s assumption that a definition had been laid down, clearly stems from a philosophical approach which tends to equate description with definition. Popper [1962, p. 34] in describing the essen? tialist approach to classification, remarks that all essentialists, including Aristotle ‘agreed with Plato in determining the task of pure knowledge as the discovery of the hidden nature or form or essence of thing.

The second problem is the tendency of the essentialist approach to equate identification with classification. Mayr [1969] and Tyner [1975] have recently stressed that these are quite distinct operations, Mayr [1969, p. 66] commenting that ‘Unlike identification, which deals with a few characters (ideally a single one) that throw a given specimen into one or the other line of the key, classification deals with and evaluates a multitude of characters, ideally all of them.’ The process of classification is inductive. After examination of a wide variety of properties in a sufficciently large sample of cells (ideally all cells), a classification of the cells into groups can be arrived at inductively, by generalizing from particular observations. A given cell can then be identified by a particular feature as a member of a certain group, but logically this process of identification is deductive. Often, however, the essentialist both classifies and identifies by the possession of one or a few essential features. For example. ‘... attention will be confined to a subset of the properties by which a neurone may be rapidly put in one or other class.

‘many classifications attempt to be both identification schemes and classifications’ and that ‘much of the development of modern taxonomy has been toward the clearer and clearer separation of these entirely different operations.’

- Avoidance of Essence-Indicating Names
- Avoidance of Role-Indicating Names

Even after these simplifications, however, two terminologies remain (Y/X/W and alpha/beta/gama) and seem likely to remain in separate use for some time. Parallel terminologies such as these are likely to arise whenever two classifications of the same population of neurones are based on types of observations which are difficult or impossible to make on the same individual cells.

both types of data cannot be obtained from the same individual cells. Thus, in most cases, an individual ganglion cell cannot be readily categorized in both schemes. As our understanding of these cells increases, one set of terms will presumably come to be preferred. For the moment, however, it seems necessary to retain the two terminologies, using each in its appropriate context.
--> Yes! And this can be scaled up! 

The use of descriptive prefixes to distinguish variations within the Y,X and W cell groups is common to all workers who have published on these cells, and might seem to impose an essentialist crust on a non-essentialist loaf, i.e., to introduce the Aristotelian concept of ‘essences’ into classifications otherwise non-essentialist in their presuppositions. We would argue, however, that this is not the case. 

These clusterings of properties may indicate some functional distinction between the two groups, and seem sufficient to justify a division of W cells into two subgroups. We suggest that these subgroups be given the non-descriptive names Wt and W2.

To summarise the critique of ganglion cell classifications presented above, it is not meant to suggest that any particular scheme of classifying ganglion cells, whether by morphology or physiology, is the correct one. We do mean to suggest that certain schemes are simpler, more adaptable to new findings and less likely to be a source of confusion than others. In the following, more theoretical section, an attempt is made to set out principles by which such schemes of classification might be devised for neuronal populations.

Towards a Theoretical Basis for the Classification of Neurones The
The two propositions are: 

(1) that any classification should be viewed not as a definition of cell groupings, but as an hypothesis that the cell groupings being delineated fulfill distinct functional roles; and 

(2) that the functional roles referred to by the classification should be defined in terms quite independent of the properties of the cells being classified

Darwin [1872, p. 576] suggested ‘... that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been seeking, and not ... the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike.’ Thus, the theory of evolution made it possible for classifications of animals to be regarded as hypotheses about phylogenetic or cladistic relationships between them, and the aim of taxonomy became, in the words of J. S. Huxley [1940, p. 2], ‘the discovery of evolution at work’

This view of classification has at least three major advantages:
- As an hypothesis, a scheme of classification is a testable proposition, intended to be modified or even discarded if necessary, and therefore inherently adaptable to new accumulations of data. 
- Because observa? tions used to generate hypotheses cannot validly be used to test them, the testing process itself results in the collection of new data. The classification thus has the effect of generating new observations, rather than of formalising old ones.
- This view of classification requires that a distinction be made between the description of a group and the definition of the category to which it belongs.

If a classification is to be regarded as an hypothesis, what should the hypothesis be about? The theory of evolution provided a functional basis for the definition of various categories, and hence for the classification of all organisms, and taxonomy came to be regarded as an attempt to elucidate the processes of evolution. Clearly, some analogous basis is needed for the classification of neurones.

--> For me, the hypothesis is that the cell type, as defined, really can be identified 
    for the set of individuals of the taxonomic scope, given the other constraints

We would suggest that the functional roles played by various neurones do provide a basis for their classification into groups; and that the classification should be regarded as an hypothesis that particular groups of neurones fill particular functional niches.

One word of caution should be added here. The hypothesis that groups of cells in different species occupy the same functional niche is not to be equated with the suggestion that these groups are homologous. The criteria for the establishment of homology are independent of (although they overlap with) the considerations involved in defining a functional niche. Groups of cells in different species could occupy the same functional niche as a result of either homology or homoplasy.
