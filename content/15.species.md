#### Chapter 1. Introduction

The first step in wisdom is to know the things themselves; this notion consists in having the true idea ofthe object; objects are distinguishedandknown by their methodical classification and appropriate naming; therefore Classification andNaming will be the foundation of our Science. –Linnaeus

The number of known species of eukaryotic organisms is currently estimated to be about 1.4 million (Lean et al. 1990; Systematics Agenda 2000 1994).It seems reasonable to suppose that most of Earth’s species have been described. But this is far from true.

Small mammals are still discovered fairly often; they are mostly rodents such as the Panay cloudrunner, Crateromys heaneyi (Gonzales and Kennedy 1996).

Taxonomy is a subdivision ofsystematics, consisting of three associated activities: identification (referring a speci- men to a previously classified and named group), classification (ordering organisms into groups based on perceived similarities or differences), and nomenclature (naming groups of organisms according to rules developed for the process)

A species becomes known in the scientific sense when a Latin binomial, a name consisting of two parts (a genus term and a species term), and a description are published in the scientific literature, according to the rules of botanical (The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, ICBN) or zoological (The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, ICZN) nomenclature. Although they are written in legal language, there is no agency to enforce these codes; there is only the consensus of biologists to observe and accept them (Jeffrey 1989)

new species are found and described by professional systematic biologists and paleontologists in the course of their research, as they study specimens generated by their own field work or by expe- ditions or surveys made by others and preserved in museum collections.

In summary, most biologists who find a new species, whether living or fossil, must describe it themselves. This bookaims to explain the procedure by which scientists who find a new species in the course of their research can perform the necessary background studies and write a publishable description of that species.

I began this book at the request ofsome ecologist colleagues who were finding undescribed species in the course of their research and wanted to know what steps they should take to get those species named.

I anticipate grumbling from a few ofmy colleagues who seem to feel that systematics should remain an esoteric pursuit. They are convinced that if “amateurs” acquire the information they need to publish taxonomic papers, the result will be a horrendous proliferation of poorly delimited species and a great increase in confusion in the literature. However, although following established taxonomic procedure may be time-consuming and occasionally tedious, it is not especially difficult.

#### Chapter 2. Biological Nomenclature
Biologic categorization is one ofthe most conspicuous aspects ofsuccessful behavior, not only ofman, but ofall animals, in
meetingthe requirements for survivalin a complex environment. –Dunn and Davidson (1968:75)


We are all taxonomists. Pattern seeking and the urge to classify our environment are part of our biology.

The importance of spatial intelligence in taxonomy might explain why its mastery has often been likened to the mastery ofvisual arts such as painting, in which talent is often shown very early and technical mastery and creative expression continue to develop throughout life.

However, despite ourcommonhuman heritage as taxonomists, most of us, whether students, scientists, or even practicing systematists, have little patience with the nomenclatural aspect of the field. 

Biologists have divided the living world into groups oforganisms, or taxa, which they have arranged in a series of levels, or a taxonomic hierarchy (table 2.1), with the species (chapter 3) as its essential element.

By agreement among biologists, scientific names are assigned or reassigned according to sets of rules called codes of nomenclature.

Far from being written in stone, the present rules are the result of many hard-fought scientific battles over the last 200 years.They represent the best compromise taxonomists have come up with to deal with two diametrically opposing needs: the need to name, to provide each organism with a unique and stable name; and the need to classify, to provide a system of classification that is explanatory and predictive.

Most naturalists of the time wrote in Latin, so the names they used for plants and animals were Latin. But their names were inconsistent and often paragraphs long. Authors of the time expected a name to serve as diagnosis and description, as well as identification (Mayr et al. 1953). Linnaeus is often given the credit for inventing binomial nomenclature, but his real contribution lay in standardizing and simplifying a system already in use

But ifmore relatives turned up, the additional names might be trinomial(e.g., IrismaritimaNorbonensis) or might expand into a whole descriptive phrase or polynomial(e.g., Irisperpusilla saxatilisNorbonensisacaulisferme) (Mayr et al. 1953; Greene 1983). Dealing with names a paragraph long was inconvenient.

Some taxonomists, like Linnaeus himself (1736, 1751), developed their own rules ofprocedure (Schmidt 1952). But none caught on widely, and well before the middle of the nineteenth century

Table 2.2 shows the features shared by the current international codes for botanical and zoological nomenclature. The primary purpose ofboth codes is to provide a unique binomial scientific name for every species of organism. 

Both the ICBN and the ICZN aim to • Ensure a unique scientific name for every taxon. These names must be Latin in form, written in the Latin alphabet, and composed in accordance with the rules of Latin grammar.
• Provide rules for publication of new names and determine whether previously published names are acceptable.
• Ensure adequate documentation and dating of names. • Ensure typification (that each name is linked to a type specimen, specimens, or species).
• By use of types permit names to be assigned to taxa without interfering with scientific freedom to make changes in classifications on the basis of new information and insights.
• Give a chronological starting point to names used (names in publications before the starting date are ignored).
• Provide an administrative system (the International Botanical Congress and its Permanent Nomenclature Committee and the IUBS and its International Commission ofZoological Nomenclature for animals) to ensure and oversee the interpretation and improvement of the codes.

two codes are independent; the same genus name may be used for an animal and for a plant.

Some systematists find the idea of any further compromise offensive and would like to see a completely phylogenetic (cladistic) classification system replace it (Hennig 1981; deQueiroz and Gauthier 1990).
