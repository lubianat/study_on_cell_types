Host: I have here a question which is maybe a little bit philosophical. Ttaking into account all this that you've seen and all these
different biological networks that you've been working with, we have a participant asking about subtypes of cells. If the human
cell atlas have guidelines to determine what constitutes a cell type. 

Orit Rozenblatt-Rosen: Ah, this is a very long discussion. I think people have tried to
determine what the cell type is and what a program is, and what the cell state is. I don't think that there are
necessarily specific guidelines, but maybe Aviv or Sarah want to chime in on that, if they're still online. 

(AV issues)
Host: We have a few people here asking if there are guidelines for what the Human Cell Atlas considers a cell type.

Aviv Regev: Oh, this is _the_ question. So um first of all, no. To be perfectly honest and transparent. But it touches on a deeper
question which is in one that you can see that people are careful about using the word type for that reason. 
Types get defined in different ways for different areas. Moreover, there is the overall state of the cell which is made of many
different programs. Some of those states represent this more invariant part of the cell's identity that we tend to call a type whereas others are more variable and they can change for a cell of the same type. 
I think one of our hopes for the HCA is...

I'll say two things.  In areas where cell types have been defined already, and there is kind of a consensus and
agreement on what they are, it is often quite easy to map that in single cell data and just see the signal
that you know. The early studies in the retina were a great demonstration of that in a system where things are very
stable.

In tissues where work has been done now repeatedly across many groups people are starting to converge to a consensus
for these invariant characteristics that repeat themselves over and over and over again. And those get kind of enshrined withthat terminology type. 

The thing that makes it complicated is (that there are) these many many other features that seem to be more variable for cells
and that we tend to now call programs. And we get out of the discussion that was very complex that
was related to what's the difference between a type and a state. 
In a sense any cell at any moment in time, when you are profiling it what you're seeing is its state. That state is features that are related to the type that it belongs to and it has features that are related to other things and there's relationships with
those features. Yes, we would all hope that the world were a little simpler than that. 

I also would the last musings I have on this is that it really depends on who you are as a biologist in terms of what type means to you.For developmental biologists, often the type is very intimately coupled to the developmental history of the cell. For neuroscientists, it is its electrophysiological activities, and so on and so forth. So that is one of the reasons that I think the data driven approach can
often be better than trying to just impose our pre-held conceptions.
